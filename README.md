Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection
=====================================

An algorithm to get the probability of a changepoint in a time series. The algorithm is described in:

Inspired by https://github.com/hildensia/bayesian_changepoint_detection, and
significantly modified.  This implementation can run in fixed space, and the
tradeoff between time and space efficiency and accurancy is configurable.

`notebooks/example.ipynb`  provides usage examples.
